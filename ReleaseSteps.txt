Convoar Release steps

Until we plug into some build and release system, the
steps to build and release convoar are:

CREATE THE GITHUB PRE-COMPILED BINARIES
=======================================
Update VERSION
Run ./setupConvoar.sh
Open project in Visual Studio 2019+
Verify compile target is "Release"
Rebuild Solution
Git commit all changed files (should be exe's and date files)
Push new commit to Github

CREATE  THE DOCKER IMAGE
========================
Log into Linux box with Docker installed
Pull latest github sources
cd convoar
docker login  # user herbal3d
./buildDocker.sh
